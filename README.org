* TO RUN

**** step 0: be on a ?linux machine? (idk for sure i use nixos) (if it doesn't work on windows subsystem for linux or mac, after downloading nix, feel free to open issue or pull request
**** step 1: install nix on your machine
**** step 2: nix-shell (flake is work in progress)
**** step 2.5: make a pull request implementing pretty much all the features this project currently needs to be a nice user experience
**** step 3:	npm install
**** step 4: ./book2quiz.sh $OPEN_API_KEY path_2_ur_pdf_here.pdf
**** step 4.5: open an issue detailing why doesnt work

half steps are slightly facetious
