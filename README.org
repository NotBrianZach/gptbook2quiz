* Quiz Mode: Start with book pdf, then

**** 0. read the title and table of contents if it exists, generate a meta summary, or have user provide a meta summary of the book
**** 1. feed pages[n:n+m] into gpt3, prepending the meta summary, generate a summary of pages[n:n+m] and a quiz,
**** 2. display summary of pages[n:n+m] and quiz  to the user, record user answer to quiz
**** 3. have gpt attempt to answer the quiz itself
**** 4. append the summary of pages[n:n+m] to the meta summary and generate a new meta summary
**** 5. record a log of all the summaries and quizzes

**** step 1: https://nixos.org/download.html
**** step 2: nix-shell (flake is work in progress)
**** step 2.5: make a pull request implementing pretty much all the features this project currently needs to be a nice user experience
